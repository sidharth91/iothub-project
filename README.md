IOT HUB DEVICE PROVISIONING AND LIFE CYCLE
---------------------------------------------

Generate Root CA private key
  openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 4096  //generate RSA  private key and output to rootCA.key 

Generate Root CA certificate:
  openssl req -x509 -new -key rootCA.key -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem
  

Generate key for device (we will call it a leaf):please do provide a common name
 openssl genrsa -out leaf_private_key.pem 4096
 
Generate Certificate Signing Request for the device:
  openssl req -new -key leaf_private_key.pem -out leaf.csr
  
Generate device certificate (leaf certificate):give common name same as deviceid which will be registed
  openssl x509 -req -in leaf.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out leaf_certificate.pem
  


Steps to upload the certificate to DPS Service
